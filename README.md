# ü™® Rock vs Mine Classification using Logistic Regression

This project predicts whether an object is a **Rock** or a **Mine** based on sonar signal data using a **Logistic Regression** model.

## üìä Objective

To classify sonar signals as either coming from a **rock** or a **mine**, based on their numerical features.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle ‚Äì [Sonar Rock vs Mine Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehaprabhavalkar/sonar-data)
- **Rows:** 208  
- **Columns:** 61  
- **Features:** 60 numerical sonar readings  
- **Target Variable:**  
  - `R` = Rock  
  - `M` = Mine

## üß™ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, train_test_split, accuracy_score)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Loaded CSV using pandas
   - Checked shape, nulls, basic info

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Label encoded target (`R` ‚Üí 0, `M` ‚Üí 1)
   - Split data into training and test sets (80/20)

3. **Model Training**
   - Trained a Logistic Regression model

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated using `accuracy_score` on test data

## ‚úÖ Results

- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression  
- **Test Accuracy**: **83**
